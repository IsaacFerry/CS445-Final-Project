## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes a heart disease dataset to uncover correlations between lifestyle factors, biological markers, and heart disease risk. Using **9 distinct visualizations**, we aim to identify key predictors of cardiovascular conditions and provide actionable insights for preventive healthcare strategies. The dataset includes attributes such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, exercise habits, and more.

**Key Goals**:  
- Identify lifestyle and biological factors strongly linked to heart disease.  
- Explore gender-specific risk patterns.  
- Validate clinical knowledge and discover multivariate interactions.
